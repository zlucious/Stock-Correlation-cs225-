## Team Contract (johnmf4-ao11-jordancs-ghoey2) 

#### Communication 

1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 7-9 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with johnmf4. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting. 

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or Slack. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 36 hours.

3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

#### Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Each week at the meeting we will determine what things needs to be worked on during the week, we will determine 2 poeple to work each of the given tasks. If no one wants to work on a task we will assing the people randomly. If the work isn't properlly balanced we can reasses and change the work load on a case by case basis. 

2. **Time Commitment** We expect each meber of the group to work 2 - 6 hours outside of the time we meet as a group.  We assign work in pairs and expect the work to be done by the pair, if the task cant be finished within the 6 hours of each group members than we will ask for assistance from other group members. If a team member consistantly fails to complete the tasks we will politly ask them in a metting to explain what is going on. Based on the explanation the team will come to a consensus about waht further action (if any) needs to be taken on a case by case basis. 

3. **Conflict resolution** If a converstaion does not work, and the difference cannot be settled; conflicts will be settled by a ping pong match, the winner will decide who was right and who was wrong.
